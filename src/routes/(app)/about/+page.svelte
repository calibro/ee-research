				content="This website is a compilation of enriched datasets concerning embodied ecologies. It offers insight into how online platforms shape and prioritize knowledge regarding chemical exposures.  Each page showcases a dataset gathered from a digital platform, analyzed using computational methods, and interpreted through close-reading. The result is an explorable “interface to the web” that, in the spirit of counter-archiving, provides epistemic alternatives beyond what the platforms offer. YouTube is utilized to compare language-specific content related to various substances and to observe the recommendation algorithm's role in forming clusters of related topics. GettyImages, as one of the most prominent image banks, provides a peek into the visual stereotypes most often associated with substances, pollution routes and chemical resistance. TikTok provides a snapshot or vernacular knowledge-sharing practices around contested substances and toxicities. The query terms and selected platforms for this website were compiled during a workshop at Wageningen University in 2023, involving anthropologists, new media researchers, and designers."
